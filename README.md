### Tips for Choosing .env Files

- Ensure that your .env files contain sensitive information.
- The tool supports recursive discovery, meaning it can search through folders to find all .env files.

### Duplicate Prevention

Our tool checks for duplicates. If a .env file already exists in your vault, the application will not back it up again. This keeps your vault organized and clutter-free.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Encryption:** Your .env files are encrypted during transfer to Bitwarden.
- **Secure Notes:** The backups are stored as Secure Notes in Bitwarden, ensuring only you have access.
- **Regular Updates:** The tool will receive regular updates to improve performance and security.

1. **Check Installation:** Ensure that the application was installed correctly. Reinstall if necessary.
2. **Network Connection:** Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
